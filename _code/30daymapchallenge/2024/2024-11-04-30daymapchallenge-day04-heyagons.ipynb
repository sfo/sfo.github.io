    "> These include street trees, trees in parks and green spaces, on playgrounds, on open spaces of educational institutions, along waterways of the 2nd order and on other municipal areas.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In addition to the widely represented typical tree species such as lime, maple and chestnut, over 139 species and varieties of ginkgo, magnolia, leather tree and other rarer tree species grow in the urban area.\n",
