    "This is day one of the 2024 [#30daymapchallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), a _\"Daily social mapping project happening every November.\"_\n",

    "The theme of the first day is _Points_:\n",
    "> A map with points. Start the challenge with points. Show individual locations - anything from cities to trees or more abstract concepts. Simple, but a key part of the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Topic\n",
    "This year, I select an additional overall topic and therefore will focus on my home area: The city of [Dresden](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden), and the state of [Saxony](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsen).\n",
    "I will try to base all my work on this or at least try to find some connection to those areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "Dresden provides an open data platform, which I only heard of, so far.\n",
    "Therefore, I will take the chance and explore the different datasets provided at the [Dresden OpenDataPortal](https://opendata.dresden.de) during the course of this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For today, I selected a simple example, which I think is very suitable for a mapping theme: The locations of all so-called _[Nagelsche SÃ¤ulen](https://opendata.dresden.de/informationsportal/?open=1&result=8A18FA37AE2044B3BE7A9EA317C411E9#app/mainpage)_ in Saxony.\n",
    "Those stone pillars are named after [Christian August Nagel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_August_Nagel), a professor for geodesy, who led the surveying of the Kingdom of Saxony between 1862 bis 1890.\n"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "To create the maps for this year's challenge, I will resort to doing it programmatically using Python and some specific mapping and visualisation libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my day-to-day job, I use pandas regularly for data handling, but I have little to no experience with mapping libraries.\n",
    "I found that there are a lot of options available, all having specific advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "After going through a few review articles that give some ideas of the differences and individualities, I decided to give [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium) a try.\n",
    "This library allows to create appealing, interactive maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get started with creating the first map for this year's #30daymapchallenge.\n",
